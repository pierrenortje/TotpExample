This code shows you how to create a simple OTP application using .NET and JavaScript.

Enter any password and click Enroll. This will generate a QR code that can be scanned by any authenticator app.

Once you have completed the enrollment you can then enter the code and click "Validate" to confirm that the code is valid.

I have written an article on Medium.com that takes you through the code here:
